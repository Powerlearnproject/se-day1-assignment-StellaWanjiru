Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methoda and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. The technology is used in writing code, bulding apps and websites. It is important for solving real world problems through tech

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1950s- Developemnt of programming languages started with Fortran 
1960 - Software engineering was established as a discipline
1970 - Advent of strustured programming
2000- Rise of agile methods


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - reasearching about user needs and system requirements
2. Design - Designing software architecture and user interface designs
3. Implemetnation - Writing code and buiding the software to specs
4. Testing- ensuring software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment- Releasing software to users 
6. Maintenence- Offering support, updates and enhancements to the deployed sotware

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - a software build methodology that follows a sequential approach flowing down like a waterfall 
Agile - Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
QAE- Ensures software meets the quality standard and functional requirements; designs and executes testing plans
Project manager- Oversees team organization, planning, executions and delivery of projects.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - Software suites that provide an comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Example Visual Studio Code, Eclipse
Version Control Systems (VCs) - Software tools that provide means to monitor changes to code and collaborate on code for teams. Example Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change requirements - 
Tight deadlines
Budget constrains/technical debt 
Overcome challenges by using agile methodologies, communication, prioritization of tasks and regular reassesments of goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual compenents or modueles of a saftware
Integration testing- testing interaction between different compenents or systems
System- Testing the entire software as a whole
Acceptance- Testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting precise, clear questions or statements for an AI model in order to get the best responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague promt - Generate an image of a man
Improved prompt- Generate an image of a young man standing in a garden and wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. 
The improved promt is more specific because it responds with an image with specific details I'm looking for.
